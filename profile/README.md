## VanillaHD -- A Turtle WoW Project

The goal of this project is to bring modern graphics into our favorite retro games for emulation purposes, specifically bringing modern WoW graphics into the 1.12.1 Vanilla (and beyond) client using .mpq modding.

Our patch breakdown is as follows:

### Patch A
This is the primary patch, consisting of character models and textures, npc models and textures, spell visuals, and equipment models and textures.

### Patch B
This is the secondary patch, consisting of world and environment models and textures.

### Patch C
This is the third, smallest patch, consisting of sound effects and music.

These patches are maintained publicly to allow others to use, report bugs for, and contribute fixes to, these patches on any network allowing .mpq mods.
